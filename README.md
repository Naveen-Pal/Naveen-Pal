## Hi Hackers ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Naveen Pal**, a passionate tech enthusiast and open source contributor.

If I had to sum myself up in three lines, it would be:
- **Systems are my friends.**
- **Open source is my love.**
- **Competitive programming is my crush.**

Are you also tired of the routine? Letâ€™s do something crazy! I'm always up for a conversation about tech, ideas, or just about anything fun. Who knows? We might build something awesome together.

**Email:** 23110216@iitgn.ac.in

**Happy Hacking!**
